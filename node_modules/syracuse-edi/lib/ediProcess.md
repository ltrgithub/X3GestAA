## var uuid = decodeEdiFiles(_,idProcess, opt) :
This function decode the edi partnet data and store in mongodb the json object corresponding to the data to load in a syraucse instance.
idProcess : the edi process identifiant defined in x3
opt : json object that provide all the needed element to let the syracuse server to retrieve his context and process the decoding
uuid : the uuid of the edi entity that contain the json object store.
```javascript
