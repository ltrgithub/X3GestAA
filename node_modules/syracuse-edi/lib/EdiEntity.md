# dropAllEdiCacheEntity(_) :
This function allow to delete all the edi store in mongodb
# var uuid = createEdiCacheEntity(_,opt) :
This function allow to create a Edi Entity in mongodb database. It possible to create 1 entity or several in the same time
        opt : object that describe the entity to create. This object must contains at least a json object to be store and an id that deosn't need to be unique
        uuid : the uuid of the created entity that identified it in mongod
```javascript
var opt = {
    id : "id of the entity (i.e : INVOIC)",
    type : "type of the entity (SeqFile, ..)",
    etag : "etag of entity when it's stored",
    json : {"":...}
};
uuid = "uuid of the edi entity created"
```
if this function is called with in option parameter a array of json for the parameter json. it will store for each element of the array
a cache entity with for id  = opt.id +"_ "+index of the json element in the array". In that case it will return a array of uuid.
```javascript
var opt = {
   id : "id of the entity (i.e : INVOIC)",
   type : "type of the entity (SeqFile, ..)",
   etag : "etag of entity when it's stored",
   json : [{..} , {...} , {...}]
};
uuid = ["uuid1","uuid2","uuid3"]
```
in any case, if it failed it return a error.
# var instance = getEdiCacheEntity(_,opt) :
This function allow to get an entity of several entity identified by a uuid
    opt : json object that contains the element to get the entity. this can contains a uuid, a list of uuid or a sdatafilter
    instance : the edi entity instance loaded if it's found else null
```javascript
var opt = {
            uuid : "uuid of the entity to get"
}
```
or
```javascript
var opt = {
  uuid : ["uuid1","uuid2","uuid3"]
}
```
or
```javascript
var opt = {
  filter : { "sdataWhere" : "sdata filter" }
}
```
# var json = getEdiCacheJson(_,opt) :
This function allow to get the json of an entity or  of several entity identified by a uuid
    opt : json object that contains the element to get the entity. this can contains a uuid, a list of uuid or a sdatafilter
    json : the javascript object with as a key the uuid of the entity object and as a value the json object store in mongodb. Can be a single object or an array of object
```javascript
var opt = {
   uuid : "uuid of the entity to get"
}
json =  {"uuid" : {...} }
```
or
```javascript
var opt = {
   uuid : ["uuid1","uuid2","uuid3"]
}
json = [{"uuid1":{...} , {"uuid2":{...} }, {"uuid3": {...}}]
```
# removeEdiCacheEntity(_,opt) :
This function allow to remove the json of an entity or  of several entity identified by a uuid
    opt : json object that contains the element to get the entity. this can contains a uuid, a list of uuid or a sdatafilter
```javascript
var opt = {
   uuid : "uuid of the entity to get"
}
```
or
```javascript
var opt = {
   uuid : ["uuid1","uuid2","uuid3"]
}
