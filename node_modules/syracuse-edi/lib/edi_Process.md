 ## var result = parseXsd(_,opt) :
 This function parse an xsd file and store the xml path result into a entity in mongodb. it can be use for create or update the entity that containt the xmlpath. On update if the entity doesn't exists we automatically create a new entity
 opt : contains all the element to parse the xsd in order to generate the xml path and create or update the result
 result : contains the uuid of the edi cache entity create that contain the xml path

 result = "uuid of the json store in cache",


 ```javascript
 var option =
    xsdUuid : ["uuid1","uuid2"], //list of uuid of xsd file store in storage area
    uuid : "uuid of already generate entity",
    id : "id of the edi process"
 };
 ```


## validateMapping(_, opt) :
 this fucntion allow to validate if the mapping define in the xmlFile is correct and supported by the javscript api or not. If the mapping is not supported this function raise an exception.
 idProcess : the edi process identifiant defined in x3
 opt : contain the element xmlFile that can be a uuid or directly the structure in order to validate if the mapping is ok.
```javascript
 opt = {
     xmlFile : "uuid",
		prototype :"uuid"
 }
 or
 opt = {
     xmlFile : {...}
		prototype :{...}
 }
```

## var result = decodeEdiFiles(_,idProcess, opt) :
This function decode the edi partnet data and store in mongodb the json object corresponding to the data to load in a syraucse instance.
idProcess : the edi process identifiant defined in x3
opt : json object that provide all the needed element to let the syracuse server to retrieve his context and process the decoding
result : the object that contains the uuid and the key  of the edi entity that contain the json object store.
result = {
   uuid :"uuid of the json store in cache",
   key :"value of the field identified as a key by the context"
}
```javascript
var option = {
   messageMapping : "uuid", //id of messageMapping
   sequentialFile : "uuid", // id of sequentialFile
   protocol : "uuid", // id of flow
   flow : "uuid", // id of protocol

## var result = generateEdiFiles(_,idProcess, opt) :
This function generate the edi partnet data regarding stored in mongodb the json object corresponding to syraucse instance.
idProcess : the edi process identifiant defined in x3
opt : json object that provide all the needed element to let the syracuse server to retrieve his context in order to process the generation
result : the list object composed by uuid of representation loaded, the filename is it was generated or the error in case of failure.
