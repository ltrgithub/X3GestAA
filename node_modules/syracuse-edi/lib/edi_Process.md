## var result = parseXsd(_,opt) : 
  This function parse an xsd file and store the xml path result into a entity in mongodb. it can be use for create or update the entity that containt the xmlpath. On update if the entity doesn't exists we automatically create a new entity
  opt : contains all the element to parse the xsd in order to generate the xml path and create or update the result
  result : contains the uuid of the edi cache entity create that contain the xml path

  result = "uuid of the json store in cache",


  ```javascript
  var option =
      xsdUuid : ["uuid1","uuid2"], //list of uuid of xsd file store in storage area
      uuid : "uuid of already generate entity",
      id : "id of the edi process"
  };
  ```


## var result  = getXmlPath(_,opt) : return the list of xmlPath identified by the uuid 
 uuid :  uuid of the Edi cache entity that defined the xmlPath link to a list of xsd parsed before 
 startIndex : index of the first element in the result 
 count :  number of xmlpath return 

 ```javascript
 var option =
    uuid : "uuid1", //uuid of edi cache entity return by parseXsd
    startIndex : 1, //startIndex of the page
    count : 20, // number of element  by page
 };
 ```
 the result will contain the list of the path with the startIndex, number of element in the feed and the total result like sdata protocol 
 ```javascript
 var result = {
			startIndex: 1, // index of the first element 
			count: 20, // number of element return 
			elems: [{},{},{}...], // arra of element that contain all information for xmlpath etc..
			totalResult: 3000 // total number of xml path compute during xsd parsing
	};
```

## var result = removeXmlPath(_,opt) : allow to remove xmlPath edi cache entity and file stored in storage area link to it. 
 ```javascript 
 var option =
    uuid : "uuid1", //uuid of edi cache entity return by parseXsd
 }; 
 ```


## validateMapping(_, opt) :
 this fucntion allow to validate if the mapping define in the xmlFile is correct and supported by the javscript api or not. If the mapping is not supported this function raise an exception.
 idProcess : the edi process identifiant defined in x3
 opt : contain the element xmlFile that can be a uuid or directly the structure in order to validate if the mapping is ok.
```javascript
 opt = {
     xmlFile : "uuid",
		prototype :"uuid"
 }
 or
 opt = {
     xmlFile : {...}
		prototype :{...}
 }
```

## var result = decodeEdiFiles(_,idProcess, opt) :
This function decode the edi partnet data and store in mongodb the json object corresponding to the data to load in a syraucse instance.
idProcess : the edi process identifiant defined in x3
opt : json object that provide all the needed element to let the syracuse server to retrieve his context and process the decoding
result : the object that contains the uuid and the key  of the edi entity that contain the json object store.
result = {
   uuid :"uuid of the json store in cache",
   key :"value of the field identified as a key by the context"
}
```javascript
var option = {
   messageMapping : "uuid", //id of messageMapping

This function generate the edi partnet data regarding stored in mongodb the json object corresponding to syraucse instance.
idProcess : the edi process identifiant defined in x3
opt : json object that provide all the needed element to let the syracuse server to retrieve his context in order to process the generation
result : the list object composed by uuid of representation loaded, the filename is it was generated or the error in case of failure.
