## Patch creation function `patch`
create a Syracuse patch
Parameters:
-  track: tracker function. If set, it can be used to show progress status to the user. It will be invoked with parameters:
      phase, phaseDetail, progress (number between 0 and 100)
-  newPatch generate new patch from source repository into roll-out repository
-  startFromRelease output patch file should start from latest release rather than from latest patch
-  newRelease generate new release (implies newPatch)
-  relNumberNew number of new release (only necessary if newRelease is true). Release number must only consist of digits and dots and must be greater than previous release number
-  commitComment comment. This is obligatory if newPatch or newRelease is true. Otherwise the contents will override the comment of the latest patch/release (if set)
-  baseRelease  optional: number of release for which the action should be performed. Default is latest release
-  patchfile: path of patchfile which will be generated
-  sha1Old:  SHA1 hash of commit of base version of patch file in roll-out repository. Must not be set when new patch/release will be created. Will be set to hash of latest patch of base release or base release itself if empty. If it starts with 'V', a version (release and patch) will be expected, e. g. V5.1-5
-  sha1New:  SHA1 hash of commit of final version of patch file in roll-out repository. Must not be set when new patch/release will be created. Default: HEAD. If it starts with 'V', a version (release and patch) will be expected, e. g. V5.1-5
-  x3Information: include X3 header and footer for patches
-  checkSource: check whether source repository is clean (without uncommitted changes)

  Remark: for each new patch/release there must be changes of the roll-out repository to commit, e. g. if a patch of just node.js should be delivered, there must be data to commit in the roll-out repository
   (e. g. just stage the changes in node.js)
