## Patch creation function `patch`
create a Syracuse patch
Parameters:
-  track: tracker function. If set, it can be used to show progress status to the user. It will be invoked with parameters:
      phase, phaseDetail, progress (number between 0 and 100)
-  newPatch generate new patch from source repository into roll-out repository
-  startFromRelease output patch file should start from latest release rather than from latest patch
-  newRelease generate new release (implies newPatch)
-  relNumberNew number of new release (only necessary if newRelease is true). Release number must only consist of digits and dots and must be greater than previous release number
-  commitComment comment. This is obligatory if newPatch or newRelease is true. Otherwise the contents will override the comment of the latest patch/release (if set)
-  baseRelease  optional: number of release for which the action should be performed. Default is latest release
-  patchfile: path of patchfile which will be generated
-  sha1Old:  SHA1 hash of commit of base version of patch file in roll-out repository. Must not be set when new patch will be created. Will be set to hash of latest patch of base release or base release itself if empty. If it starts with 'V', a version (release and patch) will be expected, e. g. V5.1-5
-  sha1New:  SHA1 hash of commit of final version of patch file in roll-out repository. Must not be set when new patch/release will be created. Default: HEAD. If it starts with 'V', a version (release and patch) will be expected, e. g. V5.1-5
-  x3Information: include X3 header and footer for patches
-  checkSource: check whether source repository is clean (without uncommitted changes)

  Remark: for each new patch/release there must be changes of the roll-out repository to commit, e. g. if a patch of just node.js should be delivered, there must be data to commit in the roll-out repository
   (e. g. just stage the changes in node.js)
