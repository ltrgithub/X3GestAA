DO NOT USE THIS MODULE DIRECTLY !!!  
This documentation is only provided to understand the protocol layer !  

To interface with print server, please refer to [PrintClient module API](https://github.com/Sage-ERP-X3/Syracuse/blob/master/node_modules/syracuse-x3/lib/clients/print/client/PrintClient.md "PrintClient module API").

#properties

Several nodes need to serialize/unserialize some properties.  
A property mustn't be greater than 250 characters and can be splitted by 4GL language like follow :  

	- Key/Value
    key1=\u0001value.........until 250 characters\n
    key1=\u0002complement\n
    key2=value2
    - or just Key
    key1\n
    key2\n


There two kind of properties: propeties1 and propeties2.  

##properties1  
Each property block contains:  

  - **1-byte** : fixed: 0x00.  
  - **4-bytes** : (Integer) corresponding to the property length.  

Each global properties must finish with :  

  - **5-bytes** : fixed: 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00  

##properties2  
Each property block contains:  

  - **1-byte** : fixed: 0x00.  
  - **4-bytes** : (Integer) corresponding to the property length.  

Each global properties must finish with :  

  - **5-bytes** : fixed: 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
