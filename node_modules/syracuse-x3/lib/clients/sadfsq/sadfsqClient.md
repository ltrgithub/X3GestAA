# SadFsq Client  
SadFsq is provided by simple wrappers around standard POSIX functions.  
The module is using sadfsq protocol layer implemented in [SadFsqComm](./sadfsqComm.md).  
To use this module do require('syracuse-x3/lib/clients/sadfsq/sadfsqClient').SadFsqClient.  
All the methods are asynchronous.  
``` javascript
var SadFsqClient = require('syracuse-x3/lib/clients/sadfsq/sadfsqClient').SadFsqClient;
var sadfs = new SadFsqClient(_, "server", "port");
 OR TO USE OLD SAFEV1 PROTOCOL WITHOUT USING CERTIFICATES :  
var sadfs = new SadFsqClient(_, "server", "port", "user", "password", secure);
```
* `server` is the hostname of the adxadmin server.  
* `port` is the port on adxadmin is listenning.  
* `user` is the system user to use for the connection.  
* `password` is the password corresponding to the user.  
* `secure` is boolean that define if the connection is secured by user/password.  


## General parameters  
In the following described functions, some general parameters would be necessary. This chapter describes these parameters.  

### File Options :  
Some following functions take in parameters `fileOptions`.  
This chapter describes how these options can be used.  
There are severals ways to create the `fileOptions` object :  

* Use an absolute path :  
``` javascript
var fileOptions = {
   path: "c:/temp/test.txt"
}
```

* Use a folder name, a relative path, a file name and an extension :  
``` javascript
var fileOptions = {
   folder: "DEMO",
   path: "tmp",
   name: "test",
   extension: "txt"
}
```

* Use a volume, a relative path, a file name and an extension :  
``` javascript
var fileOptions = {
   volume: "c:/",
   path: "tmp",
   name: "test",
   extension: "txt"
}
```

* Use directly a canonical path :  
``` javascript
var fileOptions = {
   canonical: "@SUPERV.tmp/test$txt"
}
```

* It's possible too to use a `server` property to access to a different server through the same adxadmin server :   
``` javascript
var fileOptions = {
   server: "server2_hostname",
   ...,
   ...
}
```

-------------
### Flags :  
Some following functions take in parameters `flags`.  
This chapter describes how these options can be used.  
The flags argument points to a string. If the string is one of the following, the file shall be opened in the indicated mode. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.  
* `r` or `rb` : Open file for reading.  
* `w` or `wb` : Truncate to zero length or create file for writing.  
* `a` or `ab` : Append; open or create file for writing at end-of-file.  
* `r+` or `rb+` or `r+b` : Open file for update (reading and writing).  
* `w+` or `wb+` or `w+b` : Truncate to zero length or create file for update.  
* `a+` or `ab+` or `a+b` : Append; open or create file for update, writing at end-of-file.  


## Functions

-------------
### open :
``` javascript
var fd = sadfs.open(_, fileOptions, flags);  
```
Open a remote file corresponding to `fileOptions` and associates a stream with it.  

* `fileOptions` is the object that represent the sadFsq File options. See [File Options](./sadfsqClient.md#file-options-).  
* `flags` : a string that represent the open mode for the remote file. See [Flags](./sadfsqClient.md#flags-).  

Opening a file with read mode (`r` as the first character in the mode argument) shall fail if the file does not exist or cannot be read.  

Opening a file with append mode (`a` as the first character in the mode argument) shall cause all subsequent writes to the file to be forced to the then current end-of-file, regardless of intervening calls to [seek()](./sadfsqClient.md#seek-) function.  

When a file is opened with update mode ('+' as the second or third character in the mode argument), both input and output may be performed on the associated stream. However, the application shall ensure that output is not directly followed by input without an intervening call to [flush()](./sadfsqClient.md#flush-) or to a file positioning function as [seek()](./sadfsqClient.md#seek-), and input is not directly followed by output without an intervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-of-file.  

If flags is `w`, `wb`, `a`, `ab`, `w+`, `wb+`, `w+b`, `a+`, `ab+`, or `a+b`, and the file did not previously exist, upon successful completion, [open()](./sadfsqClient.md#open-) shall mark for update the last data access, last data modification, and last file status change timestamps of the file and the last file status change and last data modification timestamps of the parent directory.  

If flags is `w`, `wb`, `a`, `ab`, `w+`, `wb+`, `w+b`, `a+`, `ab+`, or `a+b`, and the file did not previously exist, [open()](./sadfsqClient.md#open-) shall create a file.  

If flags is `w`, `wb`, `w+`, `wb+`, or `w+b`, and the file did previously exist, upon successful completion, [open()](./sadfsqClient.md#open-) shall mark for update the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file.  

Upon successful completion, [open()](./sadfsqClient.md#open-) shall return a pointer (file descriptor) to the object controlling the stream. Otherwise, an error shall be thrown by adxadmin runtime.  


-------------
### close :
``` javascript
sadfs.close(_, fd);  
```
Close the remote file identified by `fd`.  

* `fd` is a file descriptor that identify the opened remote file.  


-------------
### stat :

```
Retrieve informations from remote file.  

* `fileOptions` is the object that represent the sadFsq File options. See [File Options](./sadfsqClient.md#file-options-).  
* `attributes` is an array of strings that contains the attributes name.  
   `attributes` can have the following values :  
   `mode`, `ino`, `dev`, `rdev`, `nlink`, `uid`, `gid`, `size`, `atime`, `mtime`, `ctime`.  
   If `attributes` is `null` all properties are returned.  
Returns a javascript object that contains attributes keys and values.  

``` javascript
   { 
      mode: 33188, // file mode  
      ino: 48064969, // inode number  
      dev: 0, // id of device containing a directory entry  
      rdev: 2114, // id of device if special char/block  
      nlink: 1, // number of links  
      uid: 85, // uid  
      gid: 100, // gid  
      size: 527, // file size in bytes  
      atime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT, // last time of access  
      mtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT, // last time of modification  
      ctime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT // last time of file status change  
   }
``` 


-------------
### fstat :

* `offset` is a number of bytes to ignore until the new position.  
* `strict` define if the position is allowed to be out of bounds. `true` by default.  

-------------
### readFile :  
``` javascript

* `fileOptions` is the object that represent the sadFsq File options. See [File Options](./sadfsqClient.md#file-options-).  
* `options` is the object that represent encoding and flag.

   };  
```

-------------
### write :  
``` javascript  
sadfs.write(_, fd, buffer, offset, length, [position], [lock]);  
```
Write buffer to the remote file specified by `fd`.  

* `offset` and `length` determine the part of the buffer to be written.  
* `position` refers to the offset from the beginning of the file where this data should be written. If `position` is `null`, the data will be written at the current position.  
* `lock` is boolean parameter that determines if the write operation use lock. if it's not define, `null` or `false` , the lock and lock test is not applied .  

On Linux, positional writes don't work when the file is opened in append mode. The kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to the end of the file. See [open()](./sadfsqClient.md#open-) rules.

    * flag : `String`default = `a`. See [Flags](./sadfsqClient.md#flags-).  
      The rules described in [open()](./sadfsqClient.md#open-) function are also applied here.  

``` javascript
   var options = {  
        encoding:"utf-8",
        flag : "a"
   };  
```
