# JSNTLM for Node.JS

`jsntlm` is a Node.JS package to allows NTLM authentication.  

## NTLM protocol

NTLM is a challenge-response authentication protocol which uses three messages to authenticate a client in a connection oriented environment (connectionless is similar),  
and a fourth additional message if integrity is desired.  
First, the client establishes a network path to the server and sends a NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE advertising its capabilities.  
Next, the server responds with CHALLENGE_MESSAGE which is used to establish the identity of the client.  
Finally, the client responds to the challenge with an AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE.  

This implementation is based on the Specification available here:
