### Installation
Install streamline globally:

```
cd syracuse/node_modules/streamline
npm install -g
```

Compile the oracle driver:

```
cd syracuse/node_modules/oracle
npm install
```

Additional setup may be required to use the oracle driver, such as installing the Oracle Instant Client. See full instructions [here](https://github.com/joeferner/node-oracle/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

Add a metadata config section to your nodelocal.js file

```
    metadata: {
        trace: console.log,
        force: true,
        db: {
            driver: "oracle",
            hostname: "10.10.40.20",
            database: "X3V7",
            user: "SEED",
            password: "...."
        },
    },
```

Note: the tool checks if the repository is an X3 development directory because the module organization is different in supervisor environments. The `force` flag allows you to run the tool against a supervisor environment, even if the module names would be wrong in this case.

### Run the tool
```
cd syracuse/node_modules/tools/metadata
_node . [options]
```

This should create the metadata files under an x3meta directory at the same level as your syracuse directory.

It will generate one metadata file per table, with the the files organized in a hierarchy as: `rootdir/module/activity_code/TABLES/table_name.json` with `STD` as activity code for tables that don't have an activity code.
For example: `rootdir/SUPERV/ABI/TABLES/ABICOND.json`

The idea is to have an organization which maps to the functional organization of the meta data. We would have other resource types like CLASSES, REPRESENTATIONS, SCRIPTS, etc. at the same level as TABLES. Smaller files will also help with conflict handling. You should be able to quickly see which resources are in conflict and you won't have to edit a huge file.
