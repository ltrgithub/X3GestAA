### Installation
Install streamline globally:

```
cd syracuse/node_modules/streamline
npm install -g
```

Compile the oracle driver:

```
cd syracuse/node_modules/oracle
npm install
```

Add a metadata config section to your nodelocal.js file

```
    metadata: {
        trace: console.log,
        force: true,
        db: {
            driver: "oracle",
            hostname: "10.10.40.20",
            database: "X3V7",
            user: "SEED",
            password: "tiger"
        },
    },
```

Note: the tool checks if the repository is an X3 development directory because the module organization is different in supervisor environments. The `force` flag allows you to run the tool against a supervisor environment, even if the module names will be wrong in this case.

### Run the tool
```
cd syracuse/node_modules
_node tools/metadata
```

This should create the metadata files under an x3meta directory at the same level as your syracuse directory.

It will generate one metadata file per table, with the the files organized in a hierarchy as: `rootdir/module/activity_code/TABLES/table_name.json` with `STD` as activity code for tables that don't have an activity code.
For example: `rootdir/SUPERV/ABI/TABLES/ABICOND.json`

The idea is to have an organization which maps to the functional organization of the meta data. We would have other resource types like CLASSES, REPRESENTATIONS, SCRIPTS, etc. at the same level as TABLES. Smaller files will also help with conflict handling. You should be able to quickly see which resources are in conflict and you won't have to edit a huge file.

#### Flags
```
-i, --import
    import entities from x3meta into database

-t, --test
    test import/export of a specific entity or text
```
