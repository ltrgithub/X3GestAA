The node-oracledb test suite uses 'mocha', 'should' and 'async'. 
See LICENSE.md for relevant licenses.

## Running the complete test suite

### 1. Create a working directory

```
mkdir <some-directory>
cd <some-directory>
```

### 2. Install node-oracledb

See [INSTALL](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
for installation requirements and more details.

Install with:

```
npm install oracledb
```

Alternatively use a GitHub clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb.git
npm install node-oracledb
```

### 3. Install dependent modules

The test suite uses [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha), [async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) and [should](https://www.npmjs.com/package/should).  These need to be installed separately.

```
cd <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb
npm install mocha should async
```

Note: these are listed in `devDependencies` in `package.json` so `npm
install` will install them when executed inside a node-oracledb
package directory.

### 4. Edit database credentials

```
vi <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb/test/dbConfig.js
```

Change the credentials to a user who has privileges to connect and create tables:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  user          : "hr",
  password      : "welcome",
  connectString : "localhost/orcl",
  externalAuth  : false
};
```

To use external authentication, set the `externalAuth` property to
`true`.  Also make sure Oracle Database and the authentication service
have been appropriately configured.  See
[Documentation for External Authentication](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/doc/api.md#extauth)
for more details.

### 5. Run test suite

All tests can be run with:

```
cd <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb
npm test
```

This calls the `test` script defined in `<some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb/package.json`.
If `mocha` is not in the directory specified in `package.json`, for example if you have installed it globally, then edit `package.json` and change the path.

## Running a single test

Individual tests can be run using:

```
cd <some-directory>/node_modules/oracledb
../mocha/bin/mocha test/<test-name>
```

See [mochajs.org](http://mochajs.org/) for more information on running tests with mocha.

## Adding Tests
See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for general information on contribution requirements.

For easy correlation between results and test code, each test is
assigned a number.  The following number ranges have been chosen:

- 1  - 20  are reserved for basic functional tests
- 21 - 50  are reserved for data type supporting tests
- 51 onwards are for other tests
