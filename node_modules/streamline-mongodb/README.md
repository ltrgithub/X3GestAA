This is a companion module for [streamline.js](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs). It wraps [MongoDB's native driver API](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) for streamline's [_fast_ mode](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/wiki/Fast-mode).

Warning: this wrapper is still incomplete. The main API is covered but some less used functions have not been wrapped yet. Look at the source for details.
